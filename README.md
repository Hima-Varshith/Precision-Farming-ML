# Precision Farming Machine Learning Model

This project was developed under the **CTE Tech Incubation Program** and focuses on building a **machine learning model** for sustainable precision farming.  
The algorithm predicts the **optimum hourly water requirement** for crops by estimating **evapotranspiration rates** using weather and environmental data obtained from **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** and **Weather APIs**.

## Overview

The model applies **regression-based machine learning techniques** to analyze climatic variables such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed.  
By learning patterns in historical and real-time data, it supports efficient irrigation management and data-driven agricultural planning.
